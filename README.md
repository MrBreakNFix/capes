# Welcome to the Cape mod

###### This mod is made for the java edition of minecraft only,

## What it does
This mod is embeded within most of my other mods, and this is the standalone version of it. It gives certain people capes, if they deserve them!

## How to use

Download the latest release or build from source, and put it in your .minecraft/mods folder. if there is no such folder, make one!


Dont forget the mod requires fabric and fabric API to use!

###### (You can download fabric api at https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

Have a nice time!
